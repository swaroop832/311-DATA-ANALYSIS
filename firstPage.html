<h1> About 311 Data </h1>
<p><b>3-1-1</b> is a special telephone number supported in many communities in <b>UNITED STATES</b>. The number provides access to non-emergency municipal services.<br><br>
The first use of 3-1-1 for informational services was in Baltimore, Maryland, where the service commenced on <b>2 October 1996.</b><br><br> 3-1-1 is intended to connect callers to a call center that can be the same as the 9-1-1 call center, but with 3-1-1 calls assigned a secondary priority, answered only when no 9-1-1 calls are waiting. This system is intended to extend the system such that true emergency callers are answered quickly with highest priority.<br><br>
3-1-1 service is generally implemented at the local level, and in some cities, it is also used for various <b>municipal calls.</b><br><br>
